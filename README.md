Turn obsidian into lava with magma cubes

This is a small project which aims to make Lava a renewable resource in Minecraft. With this datapack, Obsidian can be converted into Lava Source blocks. For this mechanic to function, Magma Cubes must charge themselves atop Magma Blocks. Once they possess enough heat, they wil instantly produce Lave Source block when they move atop Obsidian.
